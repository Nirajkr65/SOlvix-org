Hi connections... 👋

🚀 I'm thrilled to unveil Solvix – a high-performance, AI-integrated coding ecosystem I've been building from the ground up! 💻✨

Solvix is more than just a coding platform; it’s a seamless integration of modern web technologies designed to empower both learners and administrators in a single, cohesive environment.

🛡️ The Admin Control Center:
To ensure the platform remains a gold standard for learning, I built a powerhouse Admin Dashboard with ultimate orchestration rights:
✅ Create, Update, and Delete challenges with granular precision.
✅ Upload and curate Video Solutions for deep-dive learning.
✅ Manage users and grant admin privileges to scale the community.

🌟 For the Users:
Focus and growth were my top priorities. Users enjoy a Monaco-powered Code Editor for that native IDE feel, a dedicated Notebook for personal study, and dynamic activity heatmaps to track their journey.

🛠️ The Full-Stack Architecture:
🔹 Frontend: React 19, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS v4, and DaisyUI.
🔹 Backend: Node.js (Express v5) & MongoDB with Redis for high-speed performance.
🔹 Engine: Judge0 for secure and robust code execution.
🔹 AI & Media: Google Gemini (GenAI) integration, Mux for video streaming, and Cloudinary for optimized asset management.
🔹 Automation: Brevo (SMTP) and Resend for reliable mailing.
